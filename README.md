# SFCardStackViewController
A way for presenting view controller inside neat little cards.  

##How it works

Below there is a demo of `SFCardStackViewController` in action. It still needs some polish but for now it gets the job done.

##Installation

Currently `SFCardStackViewController` is only available via direct download and inclusion of the source code into your project. There are no fancy build settings to tweak, just make sure you link against `QuartzCore` framework.

If you want to use it with Swift there is already a bridging header waiting for you in the demo project provided.

I plan to add Carthage and CocoaPods support as soon as possible. Stay tuned.

##Usage

Usage is really simple. Here's a few lines on how to present the card stack view controller:

ObjC:

```objc
UIViewController *viewController = [YourFancyContentViewController new];
SFCardStackViewController *cardStackViewController = [[SFCardStackViewController alloc] initWithRootViewController:viewController];
    
[cardStackViewController present];
```

Or the Swift counterpart:

```swift
let viewController = YourFancyContentViewController()
let cardStackViewController = SFCardStackViewController(rootViewController: viewController)

cardStackViewController.present()
```

Adding a new card is equally simple:

```objc
UIViewController *viewController = [YourFancyContentViewController new];

[self.cardStackViewController pushViewController:viewController animated:YES];
```

```swift
let viewController = CardViewController()

self.cardStackViewController.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
```

The view controller will take care of dismissing itself once all view controllers have dissappeared from the stack. Or if you want to pop a view controller manually you can use:

```objc
[self.cardStackViewController popViewController];
```

```swift
self.cardStackViewController.popViewController()
```
